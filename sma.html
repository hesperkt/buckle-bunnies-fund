    <h1>SMA (Self-Managed Abortion)</h1>
<div>
    <p><a href=""></a>Self-managed abortion is the term commonly used to describe when a person chooses to induce
        their own abortion outside a medical setting.&nbsp;Historically, self-managed abortion has had a place in
        many communities, especially rural parts of the country and along the border. Putting pills and
        information&nbsp;into the hands of people who need it most creates waves of autonomy for generations to
        come. Abortion pills have immense power!</p>
    <p><strong>Abortion Pills And The Law</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;In Texas, self-managing your abortion with pills is not illegal, but there have been cases of
        criminalization in certain cases.&nbsp; There are no laws banning self-managed abortion explicitly in most
        states, except for Nevada and South Carolina. Texas has a few laws that legislates the way people obtain
        pills, like&nbsp;Senate Bill 4, which prohibits shipping abortion pills through the mail within Texas and if
        provided by a Texas physician,&nbsp;&nbsp;limits the pillsâ€™ use to the first 7 weeks of gestation. Some
        people&nbsp;have been criminalize for self-managing their abortions, typically Black and Latinx
        folks&nbsp;in the South. People have been reported to law enforcement&nbsp;by friends, family, and medical
        professionals.&nbsp;</p>
