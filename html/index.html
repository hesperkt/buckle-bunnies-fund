<h2 id="about">About us</h2>
<p>Buckle Bunnies was founded in 2020 by a small group of young, passionate Texans. Our committment to Reproductive Justice has led us to dream of a world that provides compassionate care to communities as we work towards our collective liberation. We believe in healthcare without barriers or bans. As people who have had abortions, we know the unique struggles Texans face. We are proud to be in this fight alongside Texans who have had abortions and who will have abortions. </p>

    <button class="accordion">How much does an abortion cost?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Abortion pricing is determined by a number of factors like gestational age, type of abortion, extra medications, etc. In our experience, an abortion can cost anywhere from $150 on the low end, like abortion pills, to $15,000 on the extremely high end, typically later abortions. The average price for an abortion at 12 weeks LMP (last menstrual period) is $600. When you make your appointment, ask about pricing and if you can apply for NAF funding.</p>
