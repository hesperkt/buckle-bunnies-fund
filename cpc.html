        <h1>What Are Crisis Pregnancy Centers?</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Crisis Pregnancy Centers (CPCs)</strong> are organizations that often present themselves as clinics
            offering pregnancy-related services, but their primary aim is to discourage individuals from seeking
            abortions. They typically provide free pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, and counseling while promoting
            alternatives to abortion, such as parenting or adoption. Many CPCs are affiliated with religious or
            anti-abortion groups and may use misleading advertising or medically inaccurate information to deter
            individuals from choosing abortion. Unlike legitimate medical facilities, most CPCs are not staffed by
            licensed healthcare professionals and are not bound by the same medical or ethical standards. Critics argue
            that CPCs perpetuate stigma and barriers to reproductive healthcare by undermining informed decision-making
            and access to comprehensive services.
